Next, in my experiments of adopting more Web3 practices I looked into [unstoppabledomains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/).

## Domain Registration

I inferred that there is a solution in the works where the ownership of a domain would be stored on a blockchain; which sounded pretty cool! And I thought all my websites could be managed via domains purchased on this service.

It was not quite that. Yes, it does allow you to purchase a domain and have the domain resovle to your website; however the application/capability of unstoppabledomains were a lot more than that.

_For the scope of this article I will only talk about hosting and resolving your website on an unstoppabledomain_

If you are only wondering how the DNS resolution would work for a domain which resides on a blockchain and not on a www registry? Jump to the bottom of the article! (I wondered the same!)

## Hosting a Website using unstoppabledomains

Most of the steps involved are quite similar to the traditional way of hosting a website, however with a couple of key "Web3" differences :)

Steps

1. Create a website (static). Let's start with a simple "index.html" page
1. Purchase a domain on unstoppabledomains
1. Add and pin your index.html page onto IPFS (yes, this is one of key the differences)
3.1 Note down the IPFS hash for the index.html
1. Mint your domain
1. Link your domain using the IPFS hash (from earlier)
1. Enter your domain in the address bar of an unstoppabledomains browser. Or install the unstoppabledomains extension in your Chrome, Brave, etc (yes, this is the other key difference)
