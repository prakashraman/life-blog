I am a minimalist. Extremely bullish on [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) and [Ontology](https://ont.io/). Fell in love with wine since we moved to Belgium. Lose control every month or so and go on a rampage of chocolate and cake. Monday evening therapeutic ritual of cooking [Vietnamese Pho Ga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHapXkBNuTc).
