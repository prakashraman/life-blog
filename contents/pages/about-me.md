I am an architecture-oriented technologist, entrepreneur, and a DeFi movement enthusiast. Over the past 14 years, I built, led, and mentored various engineering teams that developed products for the businesses I founded and consulted with. I am currently the Functional Lead for Full Stack Engineering at Sentiance.
