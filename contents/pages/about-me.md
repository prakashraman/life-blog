I am an architecture-oriented technologist, entrepreneur, and a Web3.0 enthusiast. Over the past 14 years, I built, led, and mentored various engineering teams that developed products for the businesses I founded and consulted with. I am currently the Functional Lead for Full Stack Engineering at [Sentiance](http://www.sentiance.com).

Co-founder and Head of Engineering of a SaaS networking platform, forEva, in 2016. Product architect at a San Fransisco-based meditation and well-being platform in 2017. Founded and managed a fully-remote product development studio, Pinelane, from 2016 to 2019. Founded a Bangalore-based development studio in 2008. Grew the team to 20. Exited in 2016. Employee #8 and headed the UI division of Atlantis Computing from 2007 to 2011.

Built an open-source markdown blog-website platform [@prakashraman/notes](https://github.com/prakashraman/notes). And guess what! This website is built using the `@prakashraman/notes` platform I created! :)

I am a minimalist. Extremely bullish on [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) and [Ontology](https://ont.io/). Fell in love with wine since we moved to Belgium. Lose control every month or so and go on a rampage of chocolate and cake. Monday evening ritual of cooking [Vietnamese Pho Ga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHapXkBNuTc).
